  Let's say I am seeing details of one class in a component

  For another class, I don't want to make new component, but we would like to just
  change CRN, Professor name, class room and some other details in same component

  So we make blueprint or template for just one component and customize it for
  reusability.

  I will be making component here in different way as compare to what I did in basics.html

  To avoid same multi-line commenting for elements/concepts as I did in basics.html, I will use
  **PREV-COMMENTED** so that you can check basics.html to understand some basics concepts

                            This is a way we comment in JSX code, weird ?? I know. ;)
                            But it is what it is, lol
                            Reason is we canâ€™t directly use HTML comments inside of JSX
                            because JSX will get confuse and thinks that these are DOM nodes.

                            Please check http://wesbos.com/react-jsx-comments/ great article on
                            JSX commenting.

                            Properties are accessed by this.props.PROPERTY_NAME
                            They are like attributes of html elements, whatever value we set
                            from component property is accessed through this function
                            and displayed accordingly.

                            Hence, this way we use same component to display different context
