      Here, I am malking one TO-DO list where I have added 5 todo's
      User can edit or delete them when user done with one of TODOs...

      This program uses several concepts of ReactJS:
      * Event Handling:
        In virtual DOM HTML itself, we can define events(like onClick(), mousePressed())
        when these events occurs, we will define callback methods which tells what to
        do in occurence of events.
        Example when button is clicked, event should be handled..

      * States
        They are used to customize the components..
        WoooWoooWooo, I know you might be thinking I can do it by properties,
        so what's new???? Well, my freind, properties are set forever, they never
        change.
        Let me highlight
        "**Whenever you want to change the value of component,
        customize components by state not properties!**"
        Like this.props, we will use this.state to access state.

        There will be 2 modes of components of todoList , one is normal mode and one
        is editing mode.
        When user hit Edit, a text-area should be displayed where user should be able to
        change TODOs
        So, Each Todo has 2 states edit mode and view(read-only) mode
        Whenever we use state, we define function getInitialState() that set defaults
        of states(initial states). Editing mode is set to false which means for all
        components, default is view-only state....

        We need two functions instead of just render:function(){.....}
        Two functions are for two modes viewMode and editMode respectively.

      * Refs
        Whenever user hit Edit button and change "todo" then we want to save that text
        let's brainstorm how would you do it???????
        Give ID to text area??? Naah , you will end up giving same id to all text area
        of all todos so won't be able to retrieve uniquely :) :) so???
        Can we use textarea of this component?? Naah, what if we have Multiple
        textarea within single component, so???
        Through reference, we can get reference of one of child elements.
        We will save value of Todo when user hit save

      * Multiple Child components
        All components can be independent(components are not connected) or dependent
        on each another.
        Usually, we want them to be linked to each other so we can re-arrange.
        To have more control as a whole, instead individual component, we need
        to join them.
        Consider that I delete 1st ToDo then what happens? There should be
        re-arrangment done so that other components knows that....
        Without it, we will just see BLANK HOLE since other components will
        never get to know about it.

      * Passing functions as properties
        We want to use functions of one component in other component's
        callback functions like save(), delete(), this will be shown later.
        We can pass entire function,
